      <h1 class="display-4 mt-5" id="intro">Introduction</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        For the past 8 months I have been working as an IT technician at the
        Canadian Border Services Agency. This has been my second co-op work term
        with CBSA and I have now worked at the agency for over 12 months full
        time. I was also given the opportunity to work for CBSA part time during
        the Fall 2022 semester so it feels like I have never left. This work
        term has been another great co-op experience and I have been given many
        new opportunities at work to utilize and further develop my skills. This
        term was also unique as I was able to work with new team members and
        assist them with training and onboarding which I believe demonstrates my
        knowledge and how far I have come since I started working at CBSA. These
        past 12 months have been the first time in my career that I have had the
        opportunity to develop code in a team setting and I have significantly
        improved my development abilities in the process. I have learned react
        since my first term with CBSA and have been given the opportunity to use
        it when creating a prototype user interface demo for an upcoming project
        that my team was tasked with. In addition, I have been able to further
        improve my SQL skills and acquire experience in data analysis using
        tools such as excel to create and share reports. I am also happy to say
        that I have had discussions with my supervisor about returning to CBSA
        after I graduate and I am hoping to make this a reality in the near
        future.

      <h1 class="display-4 mt-5" id="about">About CBSA</h1>
      <p class="fs-5">
        The CBSA is the Canadian Border Services Agency. According to their
        website, <a>https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html</a>, “The Canada
        Border Services Agency (CBSA) facilitates the flow of legitimate
        travellers and trade. The agency also enforces more than 100 acts and
        regulations that keep our country and Canadians safe.”. Places you will
        see CBSA employees include border crossings between Canada and the
        United States, International airports, and marine ports. However, none
        of these places are where you would find me during a given day at work.
        I am part of the Travellers Systems Division of CBSA and have been
        working remotely during my work term. CBSA has lots of technical
        employees who are not on the front lines but ensure that existing
        systems used by the agency are working properly to help protect our
        nation's borders. My colleagues work very hard not only to maintain
        these systems but also to improve and innovate upon them such that the
        agency can meet their objectives more effectively.
      </p>

      <h1 class="display-4 mt-5" id="job">Job Description</h1>
      <p class="fs-5">
        During my time with CBSA I worked on a variety of different tasks and
        with a variety of different technologies. My job title as per my job
        description is “IT Technician” and at first it felt like I was entering
        more of a junior development role but I soon discovered that the fun
        amount of variety that exists between the various assigned tasks in this
        role would make a job title of junior programmer inaccurate. This role
        included programming, analysis, learning new technologies, testing, and
        design. I think a good way to describe it would be more software
        engineering than programming as senior members on my team would
        frequently point out different poor design choices in code and ask my
        colleague and I to think of a better design to solve the problem. We
        were prompted to think about how the problem was being solved and
        whether or not our solutions were optimal rather than simply being
        sufficient.
        <br /><br />
        Every morning at work started with the same ritual, the scrum email.
        Each member of my team involved in development tasks would write a scrum
        email outlining what we worked on the day prior, what we plan on
        completing today, and whether there are any blockers preventing us from
        completing our goals. I enjoyed these because they helped me set goals
        for myself and track my progress throughout the week while also staying
        in the loop with what my teammates are working on. It also provided me
        with a very easy opportunity to alert my team if I was every stuck or
        confused about something. Starting out and even still today there are
        things that I am still learning where my lack of knowledge stops me from
        finishing the task and I have to ask for help. I generally do not have a
        problem with asking for help but providing a section to do so directly
        from the scrum emails makes asking for help much less intimidating.
        <br /><br />
        My team also took the time to meet quite frequently during my time with
        CBSA this summer. In general, we have 2 types of meetings. The first
        type of meetings are the daily development scrum meetings. These
        meetings are where the developers and team leader of my team meet to
        discuss one of the large development tasks that we are working on for
        roughly 30 minutes each morning. A lot of the information discussed in
        these meetings is specific to the project and thus I am not able to talk
        about it here. Part of working in this role involves working with
        sensitive information sometimes. Before I started I had to earn a
        security clearance from the government as a condition of my employment.
        On the subject of the scrum meetings, their general structure is mostly
        that of a “round table” where people would go around and give updates on
        their development activities. As a student I was not assigned a great
        deal of work on the large development task these meetings were about but
        because of the learning experience I appreciated the meetings where I
        was observing just as much as the meetings where I was giving updates
        about my work.
        <br /><br />
        The next type of meeting my team had were weekly meetings. These
        meetings involved my entire team and were much longer than our daily
        scrum meetings at around an hour in length. The goal for these meetings
        was to discuss all the various tasks each person is working on and if
        any issues arose during the week. It was not uncommon for members of the
        team to discuss various possible solutions to a problem during portions
        of these meetings. Often times upon touching base with the team various
        team members would realize that other more specific meetings needed to
        be scheduled and they would schedule these other meetings afterwards. In
        my department it is quite common for people to work in a matrix
        structure with various teams collaborating on tasks or certain
        individuals from different teams lending their skills to ours. The
        weekly team meetings were often a place where I noticed my coworkers
        exchanging ideas for who might be best to collaborate with for a certain
        task based on their experience. Weekly meetings always ended with a
        round table as well.
        <br /><br />
        As for the specific tasks I was assigned it was a split between
        research, programming, analysis tasks, and technical writing. When I
        first started with CBSA I spent time reading through system use case
        documentation for the system I would be working on. These system use
        cases helped me understand the way that the system works and responds to
        certain scenarios. Variations of what happens during different flows
        much like the fully dressed use cases I remember preparing last semester
        in CIS*3750.
        <br /><br />
        This term, I was also given the opportunity to take multiple udemy
        courses for React and AWS cloud technologies which helped improve my
        skills as a developer and introduce me further to the capabilities of
        cloud computing technologies such as those found on AWS. Not only was I
        given the opportunity to work on completing these courses but I was also
        given contacts of colleagues in my division which were experienced in
        React and AWS which gave me the chance to seek help and ask questions
        when I needed to.

      <h1 class="display-4 mt-5" id="end">Conclusion</h1>
      <p class="fs-5">
        Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at CBSA and am looking forward to
        my next work term there so that I can continue working on great projects
        alongside great people. I feel that my skills have improved in not only
        software development, but the entire software engineering process. My
        skills writing SQL queries and using various database tools are at a
        level currently that I never would have imagined only a few years ago. I
        am also increasingly improving one of my personal weaknesses which is
        putting technical concepts into plain language. I hope to learn new
        skills, set new goals, and improve my technical skill set during my next
        work terms with CBSA and that this 4 month work term marks the beginning
        of a long term career in government for me.
